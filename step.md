  The application is ready for deployment to GitHub Pages. The admin panel is protected via Clerk authentication, and the    
  public site displays only published activities. The UI features a modern glassmorphism design with a clean, minimal        
  aesthetic as specified in the requirements.

  To run the application locally:
   1. Set up your environment variables for Supabase and Clerk
   2. Run npm install to install dependencies
   3. Run npm run dev for development mode

  To deploy:
   1. Push code to your GitHub repository
   2. Configure secrets in GitHub repository settings:
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
      - CLERK_SECRET_KEY
   3. The GitHub Action will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages on pushes to the main branch.
